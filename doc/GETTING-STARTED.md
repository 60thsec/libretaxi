# Getting started

You cloned repository already and you want to start. Okay, let's go together
through all the steps.

## Step 1. Environment

```bash
cp .env-sample .env
```

Command above will copy sample environment configuration to `.env`. It's required
to have your own `.env`.

In this file you'll see your pre-defined database connection. It should work,
but make sure you have your own credentials file outside this project and
your own url. Shared development environment is not a good thing.

At the moment there are no instructions on how to generate `./cheaptaxi-staging-credentials.json`
file. Docs to be added later (or feel free to add).

You don't need to configure Telegram tokens, because handlers are not implemented
at the moment.

## Step 2. Add changes to your `hosts` file.

Make sure `127.0.0.1 localhost.firebaseio.test` is specified in your `/etc/hosts`.
It's required for tests. Don't worry, if you won't specify this, `before-all` test
will fail.

* [Docs for firebase-server](https://github.com/urish/firebase-server/blob/master/README.md) -
package that we use to mock Firebase for local tests.

## Step 3. Install Redis.

Redis installation is covered in [REDIS.md](REDIS.md). Nothing fancy here. `before-all` test
will fail if you did something wrong.

## You're good now!

When everything's done, it's time to test and run:

* `npm test` - Run tests. All tests should pass.
* `npm start` - Start application. At the moment it starts CLI interface only. Telegram
  handlers are not there, and we're working hard on adding them! Stay tuned.

## Still have issues?

Yes, I know we should use Docker, Vagrant or something else. If you feel enthusiastic
go ahead and add it! Explain in detail how to use it and create your own repo!
